        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lasagna is an Italian dish consisting of layers of pasta sheets alternating with a mixture of meat (typically
            ground beef or pork), tomato sauce, ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, and Parmesan cheese. Vegetables such
            as
            spinach or eggplant, as well as aromatic herbs like oregano and basil, may also be included. Everything is
            baked
            in the oven until the pasta layers are cooked through and the cheese is melted and golden brown. Lasagna is
            a
            delicious and comforting dish served hot and is popular in many parts of the world.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to the temperature specified in your lasagna recipe, typically around 375°F (190°C).
            </li>
            <li>Gather all the necessary ingredients such as lasagna noodles, meat (if using), tomato sauce, cheeses,
                vegetables, herbs, and spices.</li>
            <li>If you're using regular lasagna noodles (not no-boil noodles), cook them according to the package
                instructions until they're al dente. Then, drain them and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground meat (if using) until browned. Add diced onions, minced garlic, and
                any
                other vegetables you're using. Cook until the vegetables are softened. Then, add tomato sauce, herbs,
                salt,
                and pepper to taste. Simmer the sauce for about 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese with beaten eggs, grated Parmesan cheese, and any herbs or spices you
                like. Mix well until smooth.</li>
            <li>In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom. Arrange a layer of lasagna
                noodles
                over the sauce. Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of
                shredded mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of
                sauce and mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
            <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 45-55 minutes, or
                until
                the lasagna is bubbly and the cheese is melted and golden brown.</li>
            <li>Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for about 10-15 minutes before serving. This allows the
                lasagna to set and makes it easier to slice.</li>
            <li>Slice the lasagna into portions and serve hot. Optionally, garnish with fresh herbs like basil or
                parsley
                before serving.</li>
