    <h1>Guacamole</h1>
    <img src="../imgs/guacamole.jpg" alt="guacamole">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Guacamole typically starts with ripe avocados that are peeled, pitted, and mashed to a smooth or chunky
        consistency, depending on personal preference. To enhance the flavor, lime juice is often added, which not only
        adds a tangy taste but also helps prevent the avocados from browning.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ripe avocados</li>
        <li>Lime juice</li>
        <li>Onion (usually red or white), finely minced</li>
        <li>Tomato, diced</li>
        <li>Cilantro (also known as coriander), chopped</li>
        <li>Garlic, finely minced or pressed</li>
        <li>Jalapeño or serrano pepper, finely chopped (optional, for heat)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all the necessary ingredients, including ripe avocados, lime juice, onion, tomato, cilantro, garlic,
            jalapeño or serrano pepper (if using), salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Cut the avocados in half lengthwise and remove the pits. Scoop the avocado flesh into a mixing bowl using a
            spoon.</li>
        <li>Use a fork or potato masher to mash the avocado until it reaches your desired consistency. Some people
            prefer a smooth guacamole, while others prefer it chunky.</li>
        <li>Squeeze lime juice over the mashed avocado to prevent browning and add flavor. Start with a tablespoon of
            lime juice and adjust to taste.</li>
        <li>Add finely minced onion, diced tomato, chopped cilantro, minced garlic, and finely chopped jalapeño or
            serrano pepper (if using) to the mashed avocado.</li>
        <li>Season the guacamole with salt and pepper to taste. Start with a small amount and adjust according to your
            preferences.</li>
        <li>Use a spoon or spatula to mix all the ingredients together until well combined. Taste and adjust seasoning
            if necessary.</li>
        <li>Let it Rest: For the flavors to meld together, you can cover the guacamole with plastic wrap and let it sit
            at room temperature for about 30 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Transfer the guacamole to a serving bowl. Garnish with additional chopped cilantro or a slice of lime if
            desired. Serve with tortilla chips, tacos, quesadillas, or your favorite Mexican dishes.</li>
    </ol>
