    <h1>Yakisoba Chicken</h1>
    <img src="../imgs/yakisoba.webp" alt="yakisoba">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The dish typically starts with thinly sliced chicken breast or thigh meat, which is marinated in a flavorful
        mixture of soy sauce, mirin (sweet rice wine), and sometimes a touch of ginger and garlic for added depth of
        flavor. The chicken is then stir-fried until cooked through and slightly caramelized on the edges, imparting a
        rich and savory taste.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> breast or thigh meat, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>Yakisoba noodles (pre-cooked)</li>
        <li>Vegetables such as cabbage, carrots, bell peppers, and onions, thinly sliced or julienned</li>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
        <li>Mirin (sweet rice wine)</li>
        <li>Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>Oyster sauce</li>
        <li>Garlic, minced</li>
        <li>Ginger, grated (optional)</li>
        <li>Sugar or honey (optional, for sweetness)</li>
        <li>Toasted sesame seeds, for garnish (optional)</li>
        <li>Green onions, finely chopped, for garnish (optional)</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil, for stir-frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice the chicken thinly, prepare the vegetables, and loosen the yakisoba noodles if using fresh ones.</li>
        <li>Combine the sliced chicken with soy sauce, mirin, minced garlic, and grated ginger (optional) in a bowl. Let
            it marinate for 15-20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the marinated chicken and stir-fry until
            cooked through and lightly browned. Remove from skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, add more vegetable oil if needed. Add the sliced vegetables and stir-fry until tender
            yet still slightly crisp.</li>
        <li>Add the pre-cooked yakisoba noodles to the skillet with the vegetables. Stir-fry until heated through and
            well combined.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and oyster sauce. Optionally, add sugar or honey for
            sweetness.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked chicken back into the skillet with the noodles and vegetables. Pour the sauce over the
            mixture and toss until evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Transfer the yakisoba chicken to serving plates or bowls. Garnish with toasted sesame seeds and chopped
            green onions if desired. Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
